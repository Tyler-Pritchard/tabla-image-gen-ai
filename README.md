# Tabla Drum Image Generator

This project aims to build an AI model capable of generating high-quality, accurate images of Indian tabla drums. Fine-tuned on a curated dataset, this project showcases my AI/ML engineering capabilities.

## Project Goals
- Train a diffusion-based image generation model using a dataset of Indian tabla drums.
- Experiment with GANs and diffusion models to achieve high-resolution, realistic images.
- Deploy the trained model through a web interface using Streamlit.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Pretrained Models:** Stable Diffusion, DreamBooth, StyleGAN
- **Deployment:** Gradio, Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces
- **Data Processing:** Label Studio, OpenCV
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
